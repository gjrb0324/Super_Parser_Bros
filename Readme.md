To run the file, go to the LY Mkfile ex folder and type "make"
Then you will receive "main" file. This file you can check whether our parser works correctly.

Usage: ./main <Makefile>

Also, in C Mkfile ex folder, you can see Makefile with macro case.
The same "main" file also exists in here, so you can check our parser works correctly.

To check whether our error handling works correctly, you can modify the Makefile yourself or check
the Makefile in LY Mkfile ex folder and delete the remarks which we have posted.

Thank you!
